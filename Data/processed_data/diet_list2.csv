It is supposed to be good for colds, but it has a nice flavor for everyday use too. Echinancea is useful for fighting off colds and flu, especially at the onset of symptoms. Catnip eases symptoms of colds, flus and bronchitis and is very calming and relaxing. Yarrow is useful for the onset of colds anf flu and can cause heat flushing, which is good for breaking a fever. Lemon balm contains antiviral components, good for fighting colds and flu. Barb Fahs, the creator of this tea recommends decocting it to make the tea stronger and have more visible results, but I usually will just brew it. I have included instructions for either method. Time is for the decoction process. The recipe can also easily be reducted or increased, just keep the proportions the same.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/11/41/06/pic4M5K1n.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/11/41/06/picEClatu.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/11/41/06/piccESg9F.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/11/41/06/picDz6NQR.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/11/41/06/pictyThzh.jpg"",
