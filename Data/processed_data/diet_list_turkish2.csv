It&rsquo;s really not a &ldquo;science&rdquo; like baking and pastry is, so fee free to play around a little! The important part is that you have everything prepared before you start to assemble with the dough, it can be finicky, but totally do-able! 

My mother in law is a purist and makes Baklava with only walnuts, sugar, and Karo syrup (and dough of course!). I wanted to experiment with a more complex palate and this is what I came up with! 

From researching recipes, it looks like Baklava is holy to some people:

Bliss! They are usually made in long, fat finger rolls, similar to hoagies or sub rolls, but you can also make them with pitta bread or other shapes of bread rolls. Halloumi is a traditional Cypriot cheese, which is still made locally by lots of Cypriot ladies - you often see the cheeses &quot;hanging out to dry&quot; in old, but hopefully clean (?) tights or stockings! Halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. You can buy packs of good quality Cypriot Halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. It can last for up to ONE year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack! Halloumi is the Greek Cypriot name for this cheese, the Turkish Cypriots call it Hellim - it is the same cheese however, and the best cheese is made with 100% sheep’s milk.

Bliss! They are usually made in long, fat finger rolls, similar to hoagies or sub rolls, but you can also make them with pitta bread or other shapes of bread rolls. Halloumi is a traditional Cypriot cheese, which is still made locally by lots of Cypriot ladies - you often see the cheeses &quot;hanging out to dry&quot; in old, but hopefully clean (?) tights or stockings! Halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. You can buy packs of good quality Cypriot Halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. It can last for up to ONE year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack! Halloumi is the Greek Cypriot name for this cheese, the Turkish Cypriots call it Hellim - it is the same cheese however, and the best cheese is made with 100% sheep’s milk.

My mother in law is a purist and makes Baklava with only walnuts, sugar, and Karo syrup (and dough of course!). I wanted to experiment with a more complex palate and this is what I came up with! 

From researching recipes, it looks like Baklava is holy to some people:

If you own a candy thermometer, try to keep it under the “thead” stage, or 230F – if you go over, thin it out with water AFTER you remove it from the heat."", ""BUTTER: Clarify butter over low to med-low heat until all water has boiled away."",

The point is to dry the butter out (because it is 8% water), but shortening has far less to start – it won’t kill anything to use butter flavored shorting either, it’s a matter of opinion.

Better yet, after it is room temperature (2-3 hours) cover it (yes, cover) and let it sit until you can’t wait any longer (at least 8hrs)… serve!"", ""Store in air tight (yes, covered) container for up to 5 days.  Some people think that covering it will make it go soggy. The truth is that air carries moisture and the longer something sits out in the air, the more moisture it attracts – especially SWEETS because sugar and honey absorbed tons of moisture. The less air is sees, the better – until service that is!""

I loooove these and always go ape at my favorite Turkish joints getting these and eating them with yummy red lentil soup...this home version really isn't as difficult as I thought it'd be! And I like that they're baked, not fried; I can even whip up a small batch in my toaster! I didn't include time to thaw out your phyllo, as I usually get impatient and just leave it sitting next to the toaster or other warm device and let it speed up the thawing. Soft white cheese like Israeli or Bulgarian feta (which is different from actual feta) is also good for this. A little fresh dill is also awesome in these.",character(0),Cheese,"c(""Turkish"", ""Southwest Asia (middle East)"", ""< 60 Mins"", ""From Scratch"")","c(""3"", ""2/3"", ""1"", ""2"", ""1/8"", NA, NA, ""2"")","c(""phyllo pastry sheets"", ""feta cheese"", ""egg"", ""flat leaf parsley"", ""sea salt"", ""pepper"", ""water"", ""olive oil"")",5.0,1.0,62.3,4.7,1.8,22.9,146.5,2.9,0.1,0.4,2.1,12.0,12 cigars,"c(""Prepare the filling by mixing the cheese, parsley, half the egg, salt, and pepper.
