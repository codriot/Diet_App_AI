197922,Tabbouli / Tabouli / Tabbouleh Salad (Parsley Salad),223854,Chef floWer,,PT30M,PT30M,2006-11-27T16:59:00Z,"A Lebanese friend showed me how to make this back in 1996. It's my mother-in-laws favourite salad and I normally make it on request specially for her.  I prefer flat leaf fresh parsley (also known as Italian Parsley) as it's better texture but curly leaf is alright. I normally buy the parsley and spring onions from the supper market prepacked bunches so if your measurements are slightly more or less it's alright, it doesn't have to be exact.  The bourghul also soaks a lot of the moisture and I like Tabbouli to be moist not dried that's why there is a lot of lemons and olive oil.  Like everything we cook it's all about the palate and who we are cooking for so if you choose to put less oil and lemons then it's ok.  Salt and black pepper to taste, so feel free to add less but not to much. The secret to good Tabbouli is that everything should be finely chopped.

Halloumi is an extremely good cheese for cooking, it maintains its shape and becomes toasty and slightly salty when fried or grilled. You can buy packs of good quality Cypriot Halloumi cheese in most supermarkets or in a delicatessen. It can last for up to ONE year when bought in a vacuum-sealed pack!

They are known as the National Drink of Cyprus, and are delicious as well as being very refreshing. We used to make these with the local Cypriot brandy, which is not as strong as normal French brandy or cognac and has a delectable caramel taste to it. We also used the local angostura bitters, known as &quot;Cock Drops&quot;, which as you can imagine, brought raised eyebrows and howls of laughter from overseas guests and tourists! A little history behind the cocktail: The Cypriot Brandy Sour style was developed following the introduction of the first blended brandy made on Cyprus, by the Haggipavlu family, in the early 1930s. The cocktail was developed at the Forest Park Hotel, in the hill-resort of Pl&aacute;tres in the beautiful Troodos Mountain range, for the young King Farouk of Egypt, who often stayed at the hotel during his frequent visits to the island. The Brandy Sour was introduced as an alcoholic substitute for iced tea, as a way of disguising the Muslim monarch's preference for Western-style cocktails. The drink subsequently spread to other bars and hotels in the fasionable Platres area, before making its way to the coastal resorts of Limassol, Paphos and Kyrenia, and the capital Nicosia. With increasing numbers of tourists visiting the island in the last thirty years, and the large garrison of British servicemen stationed on the island, the Cypriot Brandy Sour is now known around the world. This is how we used to make them in our restaurant - a trade secet shared!!","""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/30/75/82/picVorijG.jpg""",Punch Beverage,"c(""Beverages"", ""Lemon"", ""Citrus"", ""Fruit"", ""Turkish"", ""Greek"", ""Southwest Asia (middle East)"", ""Asian"", ""European"", ""Brunch"", ""< 15 Mins"", ""Easy"")","c(""3"", ""1 1/2"", ""2 -4"", NA, NA)","c(""brandy"", ""soda water"")",5.0,3.0,250.9,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1 Brandy Sour,"c(""Add the angostura bitters to a tall glass, and then pour in the brandy followed by the lemon cordial.

327458,Traditional Buttery French Croissants for Lazy Bistro Breakfasts,242729,French Tart,PT20M,PT26H,PT26H20M,2008-09-26T18:46:00Z,"I do not profess to make these all the time; living in France gives me access to wonderful croissants and other French breakfast pastries, However, these are even BETTER than MOST I can buy at the boulangerie, really! It is a time consuming process to make them, but the results are well worth the effort. The butter-enriched dough can be made the night before and stored in the fridge, and it can also be frozen. Once you have the hang of adding the butter to the dough and turning and rolling it to trap the air in between the layers, you are nearly there with the technique. This is my own recipe for croissants, and the quantity yields between 8 and 12 croissants, depending on how accurate you are with the measurements of the triangles before they are rolled. I usually start my dough off in my bread machine for the mixing, kneading and proving - it just gives me more time in the kitchen to get on with other things. I have also given the traditional method by hand, and the dough can also be mixed with a dough hook in a food mixer - choose whatever method is best for you! These croissants can also be frozen - before being baked; defrost overnight in the fridge before baking as normal. Eat these with freshly ground coffee, freshly squeezed orange juice, fresh butter and a selection of confitures, jams and conserves.","c(""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/32/74/58/nEyDFNR8QqaD4IIS62rY_0S9A0745.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/32/74/58/f5hJ7bA3Shipl0XOjpuH_0S9A0711.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/32/74/58/7jDgvTnJTXrKqezQghbi_0S9A0724.jpg"", ""https://img.sndimg.com/food/image/upload/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95/v1/img/recipes/32/74/58/pichPF35S.jpg"",

I have numerous highly scented old fashioned shrub roses in my old cottage style walled garden - great for rose water, and also an orange tree - great for making orange blossom water! 
Although I can buy both scented, flavoured waters in France and England, there is always something very satisfying about making your own - give it a go, I am VERY happy with the results.  This recipe was found on a leaflet from a water distilling company in the UK; you DO need to use distilled water for these two recipes, which is easily purchased in most countries - I use it for my steam iron!!

My mother in law is a purist and makes Baklava with only walnuts, sugar, and Karo syrup (and dough of course!). I wanted to experiment with a more complex palate and this is what I came up with!
