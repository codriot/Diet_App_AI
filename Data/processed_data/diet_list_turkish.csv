It&rsquo;s really not a &ldquo;science&rdquo; like baking and pastry is, so fee free to play around a little! The important part is that you have everything prepared before you start to assemble with the dough, it can be finicky, but totally do-able! 

My mother in law is a purist and makes Baklava with only walnuts, sugar, and Karo syrup (and dough of course!). I wanted to experiment with a more complex palate and this is what I came up with! 

From researching recipes, it looks like Baklava is holy to some people:
